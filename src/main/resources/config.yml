#============================== TEAMS SORTING SYSTEM

# Sorting is done like this by default:

# (Player elo / 100 * sort-by-elo) + (Player wins / 100 * sort-by-wins) + (Player WS / 100 * sort-by-ws) +
#  + (Player highest WS / 100 * sort-by-highestws) + (Player MVP / 100 * sort-by-mvp) + (Player WLR / 100 * sort-by-wlr)

# number that will the bot get from this ^ will be used to sort teams

# All the numbers below must be exactly 100 when added up
# 1st player will have a lower number than 2nd to make it more fair (since 1st can pick first)
# If you do not understand this system you can dm me, and I'll give you another values to paste but this preset makes things more fair
